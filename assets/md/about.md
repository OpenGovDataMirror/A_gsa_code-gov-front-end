# Code.gov Program

The [Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP)](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/) called for the establishment of the the Code.gov program office and corresponding technical platform of a website and application programming interface (API). The program office assists agencies with policy, acquisition, and code inventory creation. We are a small but mighty team with five members with expertise and beliefs pertaining to discovering, sharing, and open sourcing the People's code.

# The Federal Source Code Policy

The [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/) (FSCP) was designed to support reuse and public access to custom-developed federal source code. It requires new custom-developed source code developed specifically by or for the federal government to be made available for sharing and re-use across all Federal agencies. Furthermore, the policy supports publishing open source software (OSS).
